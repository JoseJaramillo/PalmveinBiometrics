# PalmveinBiometrics
Some machine learning methods are used to find the best way to classify palmvein images as a biometric identification. The dataset used is "Vein Dataset - CIE Biometrics" and should be downloaded and pasted on the main folder.

Python + tensorflow <3 

As for today just a neural network is implemented, another ML methods will be implemented later

I am still working on this, sorry for my messy coding :/
